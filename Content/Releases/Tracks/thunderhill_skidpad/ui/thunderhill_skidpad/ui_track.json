  "description": "We make an effort to design and setup layouts that emulate a real track experience as best as possible. Tight, technical, but still fun to drive! Please note that while all driving skills are welcomed, these courses are recommended for intermediate-and-up drivers. Tandem and groups are HIGHLY encouraged, drifting is the best when you do it with friends!",
